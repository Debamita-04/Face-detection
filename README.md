Face Recognition System
A practical implementation of face recognition using triplet loss and TensorFlow. This project demonstrates a comprehensive pipeline for training a face recognition model, generating embeddings, and evaluating the system's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar faces.

üñ•Ô∏è Features
-Face Detection and Recognition: Implements face detection using a convolutional neural network 
 architecture.
-Triplet Loss: Optimized for distinguishing embeddings of similar and dissimilar faces.
-Custom Layers: Includes an L2Normalization layer for embedding normalization.
-Efficient Data Handling: Generates triplets on-the-fly and manages memory efficiently.
